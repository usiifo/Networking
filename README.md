# Networking--Advance-Programming
Lab Exercise:
For this lab, create a client/server architecture where the client enters their information like name, date of birth, gender, and nationality and stores this in an object of a class called User. The client should send the object to the server, which will receive the object and write it to a local text file (as an object, so it must be serialized). Make sure the server is multithreaded, which means it can accept multiple clients, and that writing to the file is synchronized.
